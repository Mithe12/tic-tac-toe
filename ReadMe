tic-tac-toe


- First, we need to define Gameboard and the Cell Components along with the CSS so that we can see it in UI.
- We need Cell to be declarative component. Cell will display the value(X or O) or will be empty. thats all it need to know
- GameBoard contains the state
    - Cells Arrays
    - who is the next player to move.
    - who is the winner 
    
- Actions: 
1. Player clicks the cell --> the cell will inturn marks the cells array value --> Gameboard component will be rendered again(will check for winner and change the player) 
      --> Gameboard will contain marked user.
2. PLayer click the cell nothig will happen if the cell is already marked.

Question is how do we change nextplayer state.
how do we compute the winner logic.
